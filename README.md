dotfiles-local
==============

These are my additional dotfiles built on top of
[thoughtbot/dotfiles](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles).
They will only work if the thoughtbot are installed.

# Installation

To link them, add .local symlinks to the individual files, for example:

```
cd ~
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles-local/vimrc .vimrc.local
ln -s /path/to/dotfiles-local/zshrc .zshrc.local
...
```
